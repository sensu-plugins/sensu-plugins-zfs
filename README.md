## Contributing

At this time ideas for additional checks/metrics would be very much appreciated.

I have a few ideas that would be nice:

- [x] Check for zpool state
- [x] Check for vdev errors
- [x] Check for pool capacity
- [x] Check that disks have been scrubbed recently
- [ ] Metric for disk utilization
